CALDER
=======================

CALDER (Cancer Analysis of Longitudinal Data through Evolutionary Reconstruction) is an algorithm for inferring evolutionary phylogenies using multiple longitudinal bulk DNA sequencing samples from the same patient. CALDER improves upon current methods by enforcing the evolutionary relationships that are expected between temporally ordered samples.  This README is under construction.
